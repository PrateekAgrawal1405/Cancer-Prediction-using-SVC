SVM is a supervised algo that classifies cases by finding a separator.

1. Mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space
2. Finding a separator

Mapping data to a higher dimensional vector space is known as kernelling :

a. Linear
b. Polynomial
c. RBF : Radio basis Function
d. Sigmoid

We find a hyper plane with the maximum distance from the support vectors
